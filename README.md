# C_ImageProcessing
I am trying to reproduce some of the basic filter to pre-process images for data eextraction

# Todo 
-test if the image is a power of 2 and zero pad it or resize it with ReSizeImage function. (need to find the spot of when the size is not as close to a power of 2 than a reisize) Test suite is here for that.
